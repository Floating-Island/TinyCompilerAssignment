# TinyCompilerAssignment

Based on Compiler Construction - Principles and Practice, by Kenneth C. Louden.

The majority of code is intact,the only things that slighty changed were the language and the makefile.

You only have to run: make all to generate the tiny compiler and the tiny machine.

See the README inside the folder for further instructions.

Makefile targets rpm style (fedora).
